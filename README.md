# Game Rules

* In the beginning of the game you will be given a randomly generated number (Target Number).
* The goal of the game is to make your score the same as the target number but you can't surpass it. If you surpass the number, you lose. 
* Start by clicking any of the crystals displayed. Each crystal has a hidden number value within it and your score value will increase by that number value each time a crystal is clicked. Your current score value will be displayed in the 'Total Score' section. 
* When your total score is the same as the target score, you win! 
* Upon winning or losing, the game will reset with a new random number. Good luck and have fun!
